bio: Our mission is to conduct high-quality research in human and evolutionary genomics, using pangenomic approaches, modeling, and machine learning to answer fundamental biological questions. We have the vision to advance understanding of genome variation and evolution by extracting insights from long-read assembled genomes, accurately inferring structural variations and recombinations, constructing population-scale pangenomes, and predicting variant effects for personalized medicine and variant classification. Our lab is committed to fostering a culture of respect, inclusivity, and collaboration, where diverse perspectives are valued and every member can contribute fully. We uphold the highest standards of international integrity, conducting research responsibly across global collaborations.
